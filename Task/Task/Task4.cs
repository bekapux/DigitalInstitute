        //  Task 4: Filtering Employees by Department and Salary (Hard one)
        //  You have a list of workers.
        //  Each worker has a name, a department where they work, and a salary.
        //  You need to create a new list.
        //  This list should only have workers who work in the "Sales" department and earn more than $5000.
        //  To do this, you will create three functions:
        //  1) The first function will check if a worker is in the "Sales" department.
        //  2) The second function will check if a worker earns more than $5000.
        //  3) After you create these two functions, you will create a third function.
        //      This function will combine the first two functions.
        //      If a worker passes both checks, they should be added to the new list.
        //  Use this THIRD(!!) function with the Where method to create your new list.
        //  This task will help you understand how to use multiple functions together to filter a list.
