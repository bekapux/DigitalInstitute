    //Task 1
    //Generic Classes:
    //Create a generic class named Pair<T, U>.This class should represent a pair of two different types.
    //It should have two properties - First and Second - to hold the pair of items.

    //Include methods in the class:

    //SetValues(T first, U second): This method should set the values of First and Second.
    //GetValues(): This method should return a tuple of First and Second.
    //Test the Pair<T, U> class using different pair of data types(like integer and string, float and string etc.)
    //and demonstrate its functionality.


    //Task 2
    //Generic Methods:
    //Define a generic method Swap<T> within a non-generic class SwapUtility.
    //This method should take two references(ref parameters) to variables of a generic type and swap their values.
    //Create a test program which demonstrates swapping values of different types (like integer, string, etc.).

    //Task 3
    //Constraints in Generics:
    //Create a generic class SortedCollection<T> that maintains a sorted collection of items.
    //Use the constraint on T such that T implements IComparable<T>.
    //This is needed so that the items can be sorted.

    //The class should have the following methods:
    //AddItem(T item) : This method should add a new item to the collection and then ensure the collection remains sorted.
    //GetItem(int index): This method should return the item at the given index.
    //Test the SortedCollection<T> class with a simple custom class that implements IComparable<T>,
    //and show how the items are always sorted when added to the collection.

    //Task 4 do as much practice as you can with generics
