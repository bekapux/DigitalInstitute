    // 1) Creating a Base Class and Derived Classes

    //Create an abstract base class called 'Animal' with properties like 'Name', 'Age' and 'Color'.
    //Implement a virtual method 'Move' which just outputs a default moving behavior(e.g., "The animal moves").
    //Now, create three derived classes 'Bird', 'Cat', and 'Fish'.
    //Override the 'Move' method in each derived class to output a specific moving behavior(e.g., "The bird flies", "The cat runs", "The fish swims").

    // 2) Using 'sealed' Keyword
    //Extend the above task.Make the 'Cat' class sealed.
    //Then try to inherit from 'Cat' and create another class 'Lion'.
    //The code should produce a compile-time error because a sealed class can't be inherited.

    // 3) Using 'base' Keyword

    //Extend the first task even further.
    //In the 'Bird', 'Cat', and 'Fish' classes, besides overriding the 'Move' method,
    //also create another method called 'GetDetails'.
    //This method should output the details of the animal(name, age, and color).
    //In this 'GetDetails' method, use the base keyword to access properties of the base class.

    // 4) Try modeling other stuff with your knowledge (as much as you can!
