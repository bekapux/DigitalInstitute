    // Assume you have a website where there are two advertising slots.

    // For instance, upon the first refresh, there might be ads for Facebook and Google.
    // On the second refresh, there may be ads for Apple and Microsoft, and so forth.
    // The frequency at which an ad appears is proportional to the amount paid by the advertiser;
    // for example, if Microsoft pays $10,000 and Apple pays $15, Microsoft's ads will appear more often.
    // Now onto the task:
    // You are required to write a method that will randomly return two ads from a dictionary.
    // The likelihood of an ad being returned should be based on the price the advertiser has paid for it.
